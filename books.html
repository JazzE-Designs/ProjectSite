	<p>We all experience life's difficulties, and it is during those times that we must remember, that God is a God of planning, forethought and strategy. Even when we find ourselves in a place of hopelessness and despair, <strong>we are more than conquerors!</strong> No matter what situation we face, we know that God has already planned our way of escape and we will come out with the victory! We cannot allow ourselves to forget that victory is in our DNA and everything that God does is to bring us to a place of victory.</p>
	<p>This book is designed to help you become acutely aware of the strategies of your God, your enemy and those you can use to live a life of <strong>STRATEGIC VICTORY!</strong>
		1 Corinthians 15:57- But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<h2> The Power of Connections</h2>
<p>Sometimes we need to check ourselves and the people we are connected to. Is the relationship genuine, is the love real? Or are they just here for what I can do for them or what I can give? Do they only Love /like me when I'm giving and doing what they want? What do they really do for me? What purpose do they serve in my life?</p>
